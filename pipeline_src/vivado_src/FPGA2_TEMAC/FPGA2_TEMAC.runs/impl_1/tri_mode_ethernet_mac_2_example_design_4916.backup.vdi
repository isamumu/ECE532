WARNING: [DRC REQP-1839] RAMB36 async control check: The RAMB36E1 trimac_fifo_block/user_side_FIFO/rx_fifo_i/rx_ramgen_i/mem_reg has an input control pin trimac_fifo_block/user_side_FIFO/rx_fifo_i/rx_ramgen_i/mem_reg/ENARDEN (net: trimac_fifo_block/user_side_FIFO/rx_fifo_i/rx_ramgen_i/rx_mac_resetn) which is driven by a register (trimac_fifo_block/rx_mac_reset_gen/reset_sync4) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
